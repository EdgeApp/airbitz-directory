      <p>The entire functionality and ease of use provided by the <a href="{{ ABSOLUTE_ROOT_URL }}bitcoin-wallet/">Airbitz Bitcoin wallet</a> and directory is available as a powerful, cross platform library/API. The Airbitz Core (ABC) allows developers to quickly build products such as currency exchanges, ATMs, POS solutions, games, and payroll services and have them fully integrated with accounts & wallets from the Airbitz mobile app. The Airbitz mobile app is the first product utilizing this powerful platform, and the possible integration with other financial services is tremendous.</p>
      <p>The Airbitz wallet is built on the cross platform, C/C++ Airbitz Core library. This library alone implements the full functionality of the Airbitz wallet minus the graphical interface.  With the Airbitz Core library it is possible to quickly build applications where users to control their private keys safely and securely without compromising privacy, features, or ease of use.</p>
      <p>We envision an entire ecosystem of applications being built on the Airbitz platform with cross compatibility to access a userâ€™s funds from within various apps. A user can create an account with the Airbitz mobile application. Then in one click, share a wallet with a multiplayer game to earn Bitcoin from within the game, share another wallet with a shopping mobile app to pay for goods, find a cafe using the Airbitz Directory and buy a coffee using the Airbitz mobile wallet, then link their wallet with financial planning software to help with budgeting and historical tracking, all from one account.</p>
